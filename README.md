# WEATHER-APP

The Weather Info App is a beginner-friendly React application that fetches and displays real-time weather data for New York City using the Open-Meteo API. It showcases how to handle asynchronous data fetching in React using the useEffect and useState hooks. When the component loads, it automatically requests the current weather data like temperature, wind speed, and time. The app also manages loading and error states to provide a smooth user experience. The UI is styled using modern and responsive inline CSS, making the design clean and visually appealing. This project is perfect for learners who want to understand API integration, error handling, and dynamic rendering in a React environment.
